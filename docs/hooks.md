## when you should create a custom hook

- If a piece of logic involves state, side effects, or shared behavior and is used in more than one component → make a custom hook.
- If a piece of logic is complicated and big → make a custom hook.
- If it’s one-off and simple, keep it inside the component.
- in other words if you use the same hook twice make it custom
